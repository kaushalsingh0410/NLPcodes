In 2001 , Keshubhai Patel resigned, taking moral responsibility for the Bharatiya Janata Party's defeat in the by-elections, and Narendra Modi assumed power. Modi has been in power since then.

    "He was born on 17 September 1950 in a lower-middle-class family in Vadnagar, Mehsana district of Gujarat. He was the third child of his parents, Damodar Das Modi and Hiraben. Narendra Modi completed his schooling in Vadnagar, graduated from Delhi University through distance learning in Political Science, and completed his postgraduate studies in Political Science from Gujarat University. While still a student, he joined the RSS and went to its branches as a Swayamsevak in Vadnagar. He reached Ahmedabad in 1970, joined the RSS, and assumed key responsibilities within a very short period of time. His life, which began by selling tea in a remote village, took many turns over time.

    "When Narendra Modi was still a boy, he joined the Vadnagar branch of the RSS, which was just starting to gain strength in the state of Gujarat, as a self-sevak, started by Laxman Rao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakeel Saab, who had come to expand the RSS organization in rural areas of Gujarat. After completing his high school education, Modi left home at the age of 17 to tour the country and traveled through the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar to Calcutta and Darjeeling in West Bengal. In Calcutta, he tried to take up sannyasa at the Ramakrishna Math, but the rules there were not acceptable. From there, he went to Almora in the then state of Uttar Pradesh via Bihar and spent time in the ashram of the Ramakrishna Math. Thus, between the ages of 17 and 20, he traveled to important places in North India and understood the conditions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing his tour, Modi reached his hometown Vadnagar and took blessings from his mother. While working in the RTC canteen run by his uncle in Ahmedabad, he re-entered the RSS through his guru Vakeel Saab. As a follower of Vakeel Saab, he soon became known to everyone in the Ahmedabad city Sangh branches. In 1972, the responsibilities and meetings of the Sadhu Parishad program launched by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in Gujarat state came to the attention of the RSS elders on behalf of Vakeel Saab. After the Sangh Chalak Guruji, the leaders of the organization at that time were Eknath Ranade, Dattopant Tengde, and Balasaheb Deoras. After the success of the Sadhu Parishad program, Modi was given important responsibilities in the Sangh. During the Emergency in 1975, he met the key national leaders of the country as a representative of the Sangh and played a key role in the program of keeping the leaders secret. At that time, he took charge as the leader of the Gujarat State Sangh student wing ABVP and successfully led the students. After the Emergency was over, he held important positions in the Sangh. During this time, he went to Delhi and worked as an assistant to Dattopant Tengde, a prominent labor leader and one of the Sangh elders, in writing several books and also studied the political situation in Delhi. After the book was completed, he returned to Gujarat and took charge of the Gujarat State Sangh as a leader and continued in those responsibilities until 1986.\n",

After joining the BJP, he came to the attention of the BJP's top leadership by taking charge of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation elections and playing a key role in helping the BJP win the municipal elections. With the encouragement of the then party national president L.K. Advani, he soon became the state Bharatiya Janata Party's general secretary.

He not only strengthened the party as in-charge of those states but also brought the party to power. Noticing Modi's achievements, the RSS and BJP leadership made him the BJP's national secretary. In 1997, Advani took the responsibility of organizing the Swarna Jayanta Rath Yatra and successfully organized it, playing a crucial role in its success. In 1998, with the encouragement of Khushboo Thackeray, who took over as the BJP party president, Modi was appointed as the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Bharatiya Janata Party won the Lok Sabha elections in 1998 and 1999. While still the party's general secretary, senior party leader Keshubhai Patel became the chief minister after his strategies led the party to victory in the 1998 Gujarat assembly elections . The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership appointed Narendra Modi as the chief minister of Gujarat in October 2001 after the opposition criticized Keshubhai's government for its failure to undertake relief efforts after the major earthquake that struck the Kutch region of Gujarat in 2000. Since then, Narendra Modi remained the chief minister of Gujarat until he resigned on 21 May 2014 to take up the post of prime minister.'''"
